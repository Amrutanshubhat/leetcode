"""
Problem Statement:
You are given two 0-indexed integer arrays, cost and time, of size n representing the costs and the time taken to paint n different walls respectively. There are two painters available:

A paid painter that paints the ith wall in time[i] units of time and takes cost[i] units of money.
A free painter that paints any wall in 1 unit of time at a cost of 0. But the free painter can only be used if the paid painter is already occupied.
Return the minimum amount of money required to paint the n walls.

Constraints:
1 <= cost.length <= 500
cost.length == time.length
1 <= cost[i] <= 106
1 <= time[i] <= 500

Difficulty: Hard
